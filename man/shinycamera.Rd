\usage{
shinycamera(input, output, session, output_width = 300,
  output_height = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input, output, session}{you can ignore these as it is taken care of by
\code{shiny::callModule()}}

\item{output_width}{How many pixels wide want your returned photos/the view
of the webcam. Defaults to \code{300}.}

\item{output_height}{How many pixels tall want your returned photos/the view
of the webcam. If left unspecified, defaults to a square image,
\code{output_width} value.}
}
\value{
A reactive function that will return a 3D array with dimensions
  \code{(height, width, channels (RGBA))} corresponding to the image taken by
  the webcam when shutter was pressed. The RGBA are all in the range of 0-1.
}
\description{
Upon completion of line draw, returns a reactive variable that contains a
vector of the y coordinates of what the user has drawn. This also includes
the start point specified with `draw_start` This is the server component of
shinycamera. You never directly use this function but instead call it through
the shiny function `callModule()`. See the example for how to do this. Paired
with the UI function \code{\link{shinycamera_UI}}.
